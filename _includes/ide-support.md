## IDE Support

You can add [php-decimal/php-decimal]() to your composer.json file, which includes
PHP stubs that an IDE like PHPStorm can parse to provide auto-completion. This
package will always be in sync with the minor version of the extension and has a
dependency on the extension itself. There is no need to specify `ext-decimal` as
a dependency.
